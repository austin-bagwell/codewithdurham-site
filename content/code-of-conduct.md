## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Code with Durham is to reflect the diversity of the City of
Durham. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, mental
and/or physical ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and religion (or
lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as consequences for unacceptable behavior that
contributes to making anyone feel unsafe or unwelcome in our community.

We invite all those who participate in Code with Durham to help us create safe
and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Good Tech and Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase good tech and open
source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the
fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. For more details and examples, see section 5.
* Help us maintain an environment that encourages social entrepreneurship and civic mindedness.
* Do not assume someone has a specific skill, experience, or education or judge
  them based on a perceived lack in any of those areas. Instead, help us inspire
  productivity in our fellow community members regardless of specific skill.
* Refrain from policing community membership based on location. We define
  "Durham" broadly to include those who live, work, or visit Durham as well as
  the towns and suburbs in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or
  violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public;
  please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Projects

Code with Durham aims to foster a community interested in volunteering their
time and energy for the betterment of Durham. Given that volunteer projects are
a significant programming component, we ask that community members’ projects or
ideas align to the following guidelines to have access to our community members
and their expertise.

* Non profit
* Motivated by civic and/or social good
* Publicly accessible
* Open source with an appropriate open source license

## 5. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
  person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
  information (“doxing”).
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation,
  race, age, religion, or physical and/or mental disability.
* Inappropriate or non-consensual photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You need to have someone’s consent before
  touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
  inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Deliberate silencing of other community members in the form of constant
  interruption, undermining the thoughts and opinions of others, or otherwise
  perpetuating demeaning commentary
* Advocating for, encouraging, or any form of tolerating any of the above
  behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 6. Solicitation and Job Posting Policy

Code with Durham is a community that has grown considerably and as such our
Slack and MeetUp pages are easy ways to communicate to a sizable group of
people. We have a dedicated #jobs channel where we allow members of the
community, who have shown an interest and investment in the community’s
continued success and growth, can post job-related information. In general the
rule is to give back to the community before you endeavor to take from the
community. Code with Durham organizers reserve the right to block or remove any
job posting.

## 7. Political Action Policy

Code with Durham does not and will not endorse any candidate in local, state, or
federal elections. While some issues truly are one sided, we will make every
effort to be nonpartisan in instances where doing so won’t come at the expense
of our institutional and personal values. We ask that community members refrain
from campaigning for any candidate at Code with Durham events or on any Code
with Durham social platforms. Sharing information on events centered on
legislation, grassroots protesting, or community-based organizing is allowed. If
time at a Code with Durham event is ever given to a candidate running for
political office, every effort will be made to give equitable time to their
opponent or opponents so long as giving them a platform does not come at the
expense of our institutional and personal values.

## 8. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If
a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

## 9. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify a leadership team member as soon as possible. If you can
not identify a leadership team member in the moment you can email
code-for-durham-team@codeforamerica.org.

Leadership team members are available to help community members engage with
local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable
behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also
provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 10. Violation Process

If a member of the community is found to be in violation of Code with Durham’s
code of conduct, they will be informed in writing by the leadership team. If the
individual is not an immediate threat to the community, they will be issued a
warning. If, after receiving an initial warning, the individual is found to have
violated the code of conduct a second time, that individual can be expelled from
the organization. When expelled, they will be removed from the Code with Durham
website and all subsequent social media platforms. They will not be permitted to
attend any Code with Durham events. Consideration will be given at all times to
the severity of a given code of conduct violation. If it is in the best interest
of the community for an individual to immediately be expelled from Code with
Durham, it is the discretion of the leadership team to do so.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify the Code with Durham leadership team with a concise
description of your grievance.

## 11. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors;
and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications
pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable
behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior
has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community
members.
